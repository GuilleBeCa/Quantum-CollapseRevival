# Quantum-CollapseRevival

Author: Guillermo Benito-Calviño

The features of collapse and revival do not perfectly appear in experimental setups as they are
affected by the lack of ideal conditions. In particular, we will address deviation from the ideal
limit of a coherent state with average number of particles ¯n ≡ hnˆi  1. We will explore this
situation here below in the cavity and for the Bose-Hubbard model.
